SKIES OVER GROUND. DAY.\\n\\nSOARING OVER\\n\\nAN INFINITE ARTIFICIAL LANDSCAPE OF SOLAR PANELS AND PLASTIC\\n\\nSHEETING.  All dead and abandoned to the dust and wind.\\n\\nFinally giving way to --\\n\\nEXT. FARMLAND. CALIFORNIA. DAY.\\n\\nCalled farm only generously.  The ground dry, inhospitable.\\n\\nA dubious horizon to distinguish the browns that are both\\n\\nEarth and sky.  There is no green in sight.\\n\\nThe landscape streaks by in a blur.  Nothing to tame our\\n\\nfocus until...  REVEAL:\\n\\nA SPINNER\\n\\nBeaten, scuffed, yet owns the sky like a seagull.  It flits\\n\\nRIGHT BY US, as we MOVE INSIDE --\\n\\nINT. SPINNER.\\n\\nTHE PILOT IS ASLEEP.  The Spinner on autopilot.  The MAP on\\n\\nthe dash is abruptly interrupted by A CHIME.\\n\\nThe pilot wakes.  Yawns.\\n\\nThis is K.  You’d peg him for 30 if you didn’t know better.\\n\\nRefined features, flawless skin.  Intelligent eyes that\\n\\nbreathe in detail and exhale warmth.  Gifted with a grin that\\n\\nmasks wry for earnest.\\n\\nSHAPES begin to coalesce ahead in the distance.  Revealing\\n\\nthemselves to be PLASTIC GREENHOUSES.\\n\\nK’s eyes go hard at seeing a strange INSTALLATION ahead.\\n\\nK directs the Spinner towards...\\n\\nEXT. FARMLAND. CALIFORNIA. DAY.\\n\\nTRAVELLING WITH THE SPINNER over remains of abandoned\\n\\ngreenhouses.  PLASTIC DOMES over what were once POOLS.\\n\\nA windmill stands above it all.  Slowly, creakily rotating.\\n\\nIts bent wing hitting the center pole as it strikes 6\\n\\no’clock... creakCLACK... creakCLACK... creakCLACK...\\n\\n2.\\n\\nThe Spinner’s SHADOW rolls over the windmill.  Approaching --\\n\\nEXT. FARMHOUSE. DAY.\\n\\nCement walls and corrugated tin roof.  An old school maybe.\\n\\nBeside it a PLASTIC TENTED POOL.\\n\\nINT. TENTED POOL. DAY.\\n\\nUnder a translucent dome.  A bull of a FARMER stands knee\\n\\ndeep in a pool full of sludge, raking a nutrient rich\\n\\nsolution.  Bio-reactors slowly filtered the fluid into\\n\\nvertical plasmid sacs that feed into LARGE BINS.\\n\\nThe Farmer wears thick protective gear from head to toe.\\n\\nHood and goggles cover his face.  He takes up a handful of\\n\\nNEMATODES, pleased with his crop.  Looks up as --\\n\\nTHE SPINNER SOARS OVERHEAD.\\n\\nThe Farmer sets down his rake.\\n\\nEXT. FARMHOUSE.\\n\\nThe Spinner lands in the open field behind the house, kicking\\n\\nup a PLUME of DUST that briefly obscures it.\\n\\nA small flitty HOVERCRAFT ejects itself from the back of the\\n\\nSpinner, A PILOTFISH.\\n\\nK emerges from the dust.  Whatever color his coat was, it’s\\n\\nbrown now. K instructs with the Pilotfish with a gesture.  It\\n\\nTAKES OFF.\\n\\nK approaches the peeling-paint farmhouse.  ONE TREE in sight,\\n\\na giant, DEAD, leafless thing.  A ghost of grandiosity,\\n\\nstanding only thanks to a brace and wires staked down.\\n\\nINT. FARMHOUSE. MOMENTS LATER.\\n\\nK crosses creaking floors.  Looks around:  Kalsomined walls,\\n\\npitted windows.  All old, but clean.  Someone takes pride.\\n\\nBasic furniture, an UPRIGHT PIANO.  Otherwise EMPTY.  No\\n\\ndecor, shelves BARE.\\n\\nK inspects the few items.  Sheet music for CHOPIN on the\\n\\npiano.  An aquarium in which COWSLIPS grow...\\n\\nA pot of something fragrant simmers on the stove...  K leans\\n\\ninto the pot, sniffs deeply, when --\\n\\nHEAVY FOOTSTEPS come from outside.  Rattling the whole house.\\n\\nK re-lids the pot, as --\\n\\n3.\\n\\nEXT. FARMHOUSE. CONTINUOUS.\\n\\nThe Farmer approaches his home.  Air HISSES in at the\\n\\nunfastening of his MASK.  He eyes the Spinner parked beyond\\n\\nthe tree. Sees the Pilotfish hovering above. Pulls a chain.\\n\\nA DECONTAMINATION SHOWER rains over his suit, which he can\\n\\nnow unsnap.\\n\\nThis is SAPPER MORTON.  Weathered 60s.  A well-broken nose.\\n\\nYet he pulls from his belt satchel a set of dainty glasses.\\n\\nINT. FARMHOUSE. CONTINUOUS\\n\\nTHE DOOR OPENS.  Sapper steps in.  The floor creaks under his\\n\\nweight.\\n\\nHe scans the room.  Empty.  Sapper moves to a sink where he\\n\\nviolently scrubs his hands.  He does not yet see K.\\n\\nK leans from a shadow into the light.  A stranger, suddenly\\n\\nvisible.  Briefly ominous.  An uncertain moment...\\n\\nK\\n\\n(polite)\\n\\nHope you don’t mind me taking the\\n\\nliberty.  Wind’s a bit unkind out there.\\n\\nI was careful not to track in any dirt.\\n\\nSapper eyes K’s chummy posture. Dismisses any threat.\\n\\nSAPPER\\n\\nI do not mind dirt.  I do mind\\n\\nunannounced visits.  You police?\\n\\nK\\n\\nSapper Morton... Civic number NK680514?\\n\\nSAPPER\\n\\nI’m a farmer.\\n\\nK\\n\\n(genuinely interested)\\n\\nI saw that.  What do you farm?\\n\\nSAPPER\\n\\nThis is a protein farm.  Wallace design.\\n\\nSapper fishes a clod off his boot and pulls off a single\\n\\nwriggling WORM.\\n\\nSAPPER (cont’d)\\n\\nIt only takes the one to start.\\n\\nParthenogenic strain.  Constant doubling.\\n\\nThey’ll fill as much dirt as you can wet.\\n\\n4.\\n\\nK\\n\\nIs that what I smell?\\n\\nK looks to that inviting pot on the stove.  Sapper shakes his\\n\\nhead, pleased with himself.  Opens a cupboard, where a grow\\n\\nlight nourishes PLANTS.  A few FLOWERS.  And a bottle\\n\\nterrarium full of GREEN SHOOTS.\\n\\nSAPPER\\n\\nGrow this just for me.  Garlic.\\n\\nK\\n\\nGarlic.\\n\\nHe looks.  The pot on the stove bubbles and steams.\\n\\nSAPPER\\n\\nWhole town farmed it back once.  Smelled\\n\\nthis good a hundred miles in circle.\\n\\nTry some?\\n\\nK\\n\\nNo thank you.  I prefer to keep a cold\\n\\nstomach until the hard part of the day’s\\n\\nbehind me.  How long you been here?\\n\\nSAPPER\\n\\nSince ’20.  Came by it honest too if\\n\\nthat’s what you’re after.\\n\\nK\\n\\nBut you weren’t a farmer prior.\\n\\nSapper cocks his head at the comment.  K notes the SATCHEL at\\n\\nhis belt.\\n\\nK (cont’d)\\n\\nThat bag... colonial medical use, isn’t\\n\\nit?  Military issue.  Heat resistant.\\n\\nWhere were you...  Calantha?  Must’ve\\n\\nbeen brutal.  Not many who survived\\n\\nbothered to come back to ground.\\n\\nA beat.  Sapper’s expression darkens.  He takes off his\\n\\nglasses puts them in his satchel.\\n\\nSAPPER\\n\\nPlanning on taking me in?  Huh?  Take a\\n\\nlook inside.  See what they missed.\\n\\nREVEAL:  Sapper has A SCALPEL from his satchel.  Not likely.\\n\\nK\\n\\nIf taking you in is an option, I’d much\\n\\nprefer that over the alternative.\\n\\n5.\\n\\nK puts his gun on the table.\\n\\nK (cont’d)\\n\\nYou had to know it’d be someone in time.\\n\\nSorry it’s me.\\n\\nK stands and retrieves a small SCANNER from his pocket.\\n\\nSAPPER\\n\\nGood as any.\\n\\nK activates the scanner.\\n\\nK\\n\\nIf you’d look up and to the left please.\\n\\nThe FIGHT is quick and it is fierce:\\n\\nSapper stabs towards K’s heart.  K avoids the blade, only his\\n\\ncoat and the wall are pierced by Sapper’s knife now stuck\\n\\ndeep into the wall.  K breaks Sapper’s hold on the knife,\\n\\nwhich skids to the floor.\\n\\nK DUCKS a heavy fist that sinks into the wall where his head\\n\\njust was.  Sapper grabs K by his belt and collar, lifting him\\n\\ninto the air and slamming him into the wall over and over --\\n\\nuntil K’s body GOES THROUGH IT, and --\\n\\nK crashes onto the floor in the next room.\\n\\nK recovers quickly, strangely able to withstand the\\n\\npunishment.  He sees Sapper charge through the wall to finish\\n\\nthe job.\\n\\nSapper is on him -- a vice lock around K’s throat -- K\\n\\ngasping for air.\\n\\nK gets out of Sapper’s grip, and lashes out in rapid\\n\\nsuccession, his solar plexus, his chin, his throat, crushing\\n\\nhis windpipe.  His blows are SURGICAL, anatomically precise,\\n\\nlike viper bites.\\n\\nSapper is stunned, choking, in pain.  K kicks Sappers’ knee\\n\\nand the giant drops to the floor like a felled oak tree.\\n\\nK SNATCHES Sapper’s THROAT -- SQUEEZING -- thumb SLIDING\\n\\nUPWARD as -- Sapper GASPS... FLAILS... hand reaching...\\n\\nFor the dropped SCALPEL... GRASPING IT!\\n\\nHE STABS K in the SHOULDER.\\n\\nK accepts the wound and the pain.  Only squeezes tighter.\\n\\n6.\\n\\nSapper’s EYES ROLL BACK -- the desired effect -- REVEALING:\\n\\nA PINPRICK OF COLOR on the underside of the right EYEBALL.\\n\\nK draws the SCANNER -- which reads the point like a bar code.\\n\\nIt confirms Sapper’s ID.\\n\\nK stops holding back -- SNAPS Sapper’s remaining good arm --\\n\\ngrabs his GUN that has fallen on the floor beside the table.\\n\\nK (cont’d)\\n\\nPlease don’t get up.\\n\\nSapper raises up still fighting for air.\\n\\nSAPPER\\n\\nHow does it feel, killing your own kind?\\n\\nK\\n\\nI don’t retire my own kind.  We don’t\\n\\nrun.  Only old models run.\\n\\nSAPPER\\n\\nYou new models.  You’re happy scraping\\n\\nthe shit.  You’ve never seen a miracle.\\n\\nSapper gives a zealot’s grin.  Ready to die for a cause only\\n\\nhe understands.  Eager for it.  HE RUSHES K.\\n\\nTHE GUN THUNDERS.\\n\\nHOLD ON THE GUN.  So we only HEAR Sapper’s body DROP.\\n\\nK breathes heavy.  Checks his wound.  Sees his BLOOD on his\\n\\nFINGERS.\\n\\nBlood trickles onto fallen sheet music.  Staining Chopin.\\n\\nK smooths himself back to dignity.  Leans over the body.\\n\\nThen PAUSES.  Crosses the room.  Finds a spoon.  Hesitates.\\n\\nTastes the soup.  Hmmm.  Garlic.\\n\\nEXT. FARMHOUSE. MOMENTS LATER.\\n\\nK steps out.  Looks up at a sliver of sun eking through the\\n\\ndense clouds.  The Pilotfish is hovering above the farm.\\n\\nIn one hand he holds SAPPER’S GLASSES.  In the other he holds\\n\\na small, clear CASE.  INSIDE IS SAPPER’S EYE.  He staggers\\n\\ntoward his Spinner.  Gestures to the Pilotfish.\\n\\nK\\n\\nPhotograph everything.\\n\\nThe Pilotfish rises to take pictures of the farm.\\n\\n7.\\n\\nINT. SPINNER.\\n\\nK taps a button on the dash.  An LAPD LOGO comes up.\\n\\nK\\n\\nMadam, please.\\n\\nON SCREEN comes the perpetually disappointed face of LT.\\n\\nJOSHI.  A 50ish woman.  Ambitious, officious, impatient.  K’s\\n\\nbacktalk gives fuel to her irritation so she tolerates it.\\n\\nOr maybe she just likes the look of him.  More than she\\n\\nshould.  She sees his BLOODY shoulder.\\n\\nJOSHI (ON SCREEN)\\n\\nYou’re hurt.  I’m not paying for that.\\n\\nK\\n\\nI’ll glue it.\\n\\nJOSHI (ON SCREEN)\\n\\nAnd?\\n\\nIn answer K holds up the CASE with SAPPER’S EYE.  The\\n\\npinprick of his CODE below the cornea.  It SCANS.  Sapper’s\\n\\nSERIAL NUMBER and history open.  A NEXUS 8 for the curious.\\n\\nJOSHI (ON SCREEN) (cont’d)\\n\\nOne of the tail end Nexus 8s before\\n\\nProhibition.  Looks like he could take\\n\\nyour head off.\\n\\nK\\n\\nHe thought about it.\\n\\nJOSHI (ON SCREEN)\\n\\nField medic, standard ocular ID upgrades,\\n\\nopen end lifespan, now ended.  He went\\n\\nAWOL after Calantha with a few more in\\n\\nhis outfit I wouldn’t mind closing out.\\n\\nJust him?\\n\\nMORE NEXUS 8 IDs flit by.  All wanting to be retired.\\n\\nK\\n\\nJust the one.\\n\\nJOSHI (ON SCREEN)\\n\\nBetween the retirement and the bleed\\n\\nyou’ll see a tidy bonus.  Less mine.\\n\\nK\\n\\nCan I get it today?\\n\\n8.\\n\\nJOSHI (ON SCREEN)\\n\\nI don’t know what you all do with cash in\\n\\npocket anyway.  Come on home for your\\n\\nbaseline.\\n\\nSomething catches K’s eye.  By that TREE.  Low to the ground.\\n\\nThe smallest pop of YELLOW... against a dirt brown world.\\n\\nK\\n\\nMoment, Madam.\\n\\nEXT. FARMHOUSE.\\n\\nHe kneels at the foot of the tree to find:\\n\\nA SINGLE, SLENDER COWSLIP.  Left leaning against a root.\\n\\nK lifts it to his eye.  As if moved by its delicacy.  He\\n\\nconsiders the long dead tree.  Gestures to the Pilotfish --\\n\\nK\\n\\nThere.  30 meters to maximum depth.\\n\\nThe Pilotfish begins a spiral over the area.\\n\\nON THE SCREEN:  An ULTRASOUND of the ground below.  Root\\n\\nsystems.  A cracked foundation.  And there, buried DEEP under\\n\\nthe tree...  A SMALL SEALED SQUARE FOOTLOCKER.\\n\\nJoshi sees it in her office as well.  Annoyed at more work.\\n\\nJOSHI (ON SCREEN)\\n\\nWhat is that?\\n\\nK\\n\\nIt’s down in deep.  Send a dig team,\\n\\nMadam?\\n\\nJoshi SIGHS, annoyed.\\n\\nK (cont’d)\\n\\nShould I find a shovel, spare your night?\\n\\nJOSHI (ON SCREEN)\\n\\n(yes, but...)\\n\\nYou better get back ahead of the storm.\\n\\nThe Pilotfish attaches itself to the spinner as it takes off.\\n\\nCamera moves toward the tree as we --\\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\n9.\\n\\nEXT. SKIES ABOVE LOS ANGELES. NIGHT.\\n\\nLIGHTNING shatters the sky into irregular jigsaw shapes.\\n\\nIndeed, there is a storm collecting to the north.  We are...\\n\\nSOARING OVER\\n\\nThe breathtaking cityscape skyline of dystopian grime.  30\\n\\nyears older.  Sweatier.  Sucked of oxygen.  If LA then was a\\n\\ngiant oil refinery then, now it is industrial bones jutting\\n\\nout of a new city built atop the old.  And spread far as the\\n\\neye can see.  What were streets are canyons that cut deep\\n\\ndown to the strata below.  Who knows how far.\\n\\nK’S SPINNER\\n\\nIs a single bulb in the Christmas tree.  Part of the SPINNER\\n\\nTRAFFIC that lights up the sky.  Now gliding for the city’s\\n\\npoorer, uglier center.  A seizure of ADVERTISEMENT,\\n\\ninteractive and bright.  In the distance is a massive\\n\\nstructure:  THE SEPULVEDA SEAWALL.\\n\\nINTERVIEWER (O.S.)\\n\\nSubject:  Officer K D6-dash-3-dot-7.\\n\\nLet’s begin.  Ready?\\n\\nK (O.S.)\\n\\nYes, Sir.\\n\\nINTERVIEWER (O.S.)\\n\\nRecite your baseline.\\n\\nWe see K through his rain streaked windshield as the Spinner\\n\\nbanks and begins its descent toward a grey cinder block of a\\n\\nbuilding.  RUNNING LIGHTS illuminate a LANDING PAD at the top\\n\\nof the LAPD TOWER / DIVISION 5.\\n\\nK (O.S.)\\n\\n“And blood-black nothingness began to\\n\\nspin / A system of cells interlinked\\n\\nwithin / Cells interlinked within cells\\n\\ninterlinked / Within one stem.”\\n\\nINT. POLICE STATION. PROCESSING HALL. NIGHT.\\n\\nLifeless architecture.  Huge, with worn out plastic features.\\n\\nCall it functional to be nice.\\n\\nThough it is late it is CROWDED.  Bloody-nosed K walks\\n\\nthrough a chaotic hive of crime processing.  CRIMINALS\\n\\npleading cases at plexi-covered booths...  or shouting into\\n\\npayport phone banks...\\n\\nThe HUMAN COPS still manage to get in K’s way, sure to remind\\n\\nhim of his place and esteem as a Replicant.\\n\\n10.\\n\\nCOP\\n\\nFuck off, Skinjob.\\n\\nIf that bothers K he does not let on.\\n\\nK (O.S.)\\n\\n“And dreadfully distinct / Against the\\n\\ndark, a tall white fountain played.”\\n\\nINT. INTERVIEW ROOM. DAY.\\n\\nA clinical room that was white a decade ago maybe.  The\\n\\nINTERVIEWER can be heard but not seen.\\n\\nThe long barrelled LENS of a specialized CAMERA slides back\\n\\nand forth to find its specific focus on K, who sits on a\\n\\nstool.  Coat off and on his lap.  Dry blood on his cut shirt.\\n\\nHe stares ahead at the camera.  Compliant and still.\\n\\nThe CAMERA alters its focus accusingly.  Locks in.\\n\\nINTERVIEWER (O.S.)\\n\\n(sudden and forceful)\\n\\nCells.\\n\\nCells.\\n\\nK\\n\\nINTERVIEWER (O.S.)\\n\\nHave you ever been in an institution?\\n\\nCells.\\n\\nK\\n\\nCells.\\n\\nINTERVIEWER (O.S.)\\n\\nDo they keep you in a cell.  Cells.\\n\\nK\\n\\nCells.\\n\\nINTERVIEWER (O.S.)\\n\\nWhen you are not performing your duties\\n\\ndo they keep you in a little box?  Cells.\\n\\nK\\n\\nCells.\\n\\nINTERVIEWER (O.S.)\\n\\nInterlinked.\\n\\nK\\n\\nInterlinked.\\n\\n11.\\n\\nINTERVIEWER (O.S.)\\n\\nWhat’s it like to hold the hand of\\n\\nsomeone you love.  Interlinked.\\n\\nK\\n\\nInterlinked.\\n\\nINTERVIEWER (O.S.)\\n\\nDid they teach you how to feel, finger to\\n\\nfinger?  Interlinked.\\n\\nK\\n\\nInterlinked.\\n\\nINTERVIEWER (O.S.)\\n\\nDo you long for having your heart\\n\\ninterlinked.  Interlinked.\\n\\nK\\n\\nInterlinked.\\n\\nINTERVIEWER (O.S.)\\n\\nDo you dream about being interlinked?\\n\\nInterlinked.\\n\\nA moment’s hesitation.  Then --\\n\\nK\\n\\nInterlinked.\\n\\nINTERVIEWER (O.S.)\\n\\nWhat’s it like to hold your child in your\\n\\narms?  Interlinked.\\n\\nK\\n\\nInterlinked.\\n\\nINTERVIEWER (O.S.)\\n\\nDo you feel like there is a part of you\\n\\nthat is missing?  Interlinked.\\n\\nK\\n\\nInterlinked.\\n\\nINTERVIEWER (O.S.)\\n\\nWithin cells interlinked.\\n\\nK\\n\\nWithin cells interlinked.\\n\\nINTERVIEWER (O.S.)\\n\\nSay that three times.  Within cells\\n\\ninterlinked.\\n\\n12.\\n\\nK\\n\\nWithin cells interlinked.  Within cells\\n\\ninterlinked.  Within cells interlinked.\\n\\nA pause, a grinding of unseen machinery, the camera powering\\n\\ndown, then --\\n\\nINTERVIEWER (O.S.)\\n\\n(kindly)\\n\\nWe’re done.  Constant K.  You can pick up\\n\\nyour bonus.\\n\\nK’s eyes look to the eye of the camera.\\n\\nK\\n\\nThank you, Sir.\\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\nEXT. CITY STREET.\\n\\nA POLICE SPINNER glides low overhead.  A small ADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nDRONE hovers like an insect, projecting 3D ads in the smoggy\\n\\natmosphere.  A HUGE SNOW MELTING MACHINE moves down the\\n\\nstreet, clearing the slush.  It passes to REVEAL --\\n\\nK.  He pushes past the occlusion of PEOPLE buttoned against\\n\\nthe cold.  Crosses the windblown street.  Gutters heaped with\\n\\ndirty snow as more dirty snow falls.  Fat, sooty flakes.\\n\\nHe carries a newly purchased PACKAGE under his arm.\\n\\nEXT. K’S APARTMENT COMPLEX\\n\\nA grand, old office building.  TILT DOWN the building’s\\n\\nfacade as K enters...\\n\\nINT. K’S APARTMENT COMPLEX.\\n\\nThe office building has been hastily and cheaply retrofitted\\n\\nfor residential living.  DENSELY crowded with FAMILY LIFE.\\n\\nThe many RESIDENTS, too poor or genetically problematic to\\n\\nget Off-World, treat the halls and stairway landings like a\\n\\ndorm commons.  An extension of their own homes.\\n\\nPungent signs of ethnicity everywhere.  Colors, carpets,\\n\\nclothes.  As many languages as shades of skin.  K gives a nod\\n\\nof acknowledgment to a man smoking in the hall.  Is\\n\\nacknowledged back with a stream of foreign epithets that\\n\\nfollow him up...\\n\\nINT. K’S APARTMENT COMPLEX. CONTINUED.\\n\\nFIND K ON THE STAIRS\\n\\n13.\\n\\nWalking up 80 stories.  Stiff from the fight.  An OLD WOMAN\\n\\nbumps into him, expecting him to get out of her way.  No one\\n\\nhe passes the least glad to see a Replicant.\\n\\nINT. HALLWAY.\\n\\nK crosses the hall.  ALL his NEIGHBORS’ DOORS are open like\\n\\nmarket stalls letting in air and letting out CHILDREN.  Every\\n\\nhome thickly filled, like a hoarder’s garage.  Some host\\n\\nSHOPS.  FOOD STALLS.  Every floor like a town square.\\n\\nK walks past and to his apartment.  A BOY, brown-faced,\\n\\nmissing an ear, looking up at K, with curiosity and fear.\\n\\nK opens the lock.  Disappears inside.  The only one to close\\n\\nhis door, which is tagged with a GRAFFITI:  “FUCK OFF\\n\\nSKINNER.”\\n\\nEXT. K’S APARTMENT. NIGHT.\\n\\nPUSH IN ON K’S WINDOW, as a LIGHT turns on within...\\n\\nINT. K’S APARTMENT.\\n\\nA sparsely adorned space in clear contrast to his neighbors.\\n\\nNo pretense of cultural heritage.  A simple chair.  On its\\n\\narm a valueless paperback novel, well-thumbed, noted,\\n\\ncreased.  Nabokov’s maddening “PALE FIRE” as it happens, not\\n\\nthat we make a thing of it.\\n\\nK walks in with his package, trying to be discreet, he hides\\n\\nit as...\\n\\nHe turns on a CONSOLE.  Perhaps a MUSIC PLAYER, which spins a\\n\\nSINATRA song, “Summer Winds.”\\n\\nK takes off his coat.  Seems more annoyed at the scalpel tear\\n\\nin the fabric than the shoulder wound he sustained under it.\\n\\nWOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)\\n\\nK!  I didn’t hear you.  You’re early!\\n\\nK\\n\\nYou want me to come back?\\n\\nJOI (O.S.)\\n\\n(a laugh)\\n\\nGo scrub.\\n\\nJust hearing it helps take away the pain.  K relaxes into\\n\\nthis normal domestic scene.\\n\\n14.\\n\\nINT. SHOWER.\\n\\nK washes off the day’s dust and blood.  Jets shower.  Five\\n\\nseconds of water.\\n\\nINT. BATHROOM.\\n\\nK at a mirror eyes his shoulder WOUND.\\n\\nJOI (O.S.)\\n\\nHow was your meeting?\\n\\nHe squeezes the contents of a thin nosed TUBE onto it.\\n\\nPlatelet jelly.  The skin rebonds.  Gluing it after all.\\n\\nK\\n\\nThe usual.  How was your day?\\n\\nJOI (O.S.)\\n\\nI’m getting cabin fever.\\n\\nINT. KITCHEN.\\n\\nK cooks in a corridor kitchen that looks like one we would\\n\\nfind in a very old space station.  He cooks with dexterity,\\n\\ntrying to be light, as he makes a prefab meal.\\n\\nK\\n\\nI had an accident at work.

Pour me one, will you.\\n\\nINT. K’S APARTMENT.\\n\\nK crosses in, pours two drinks.  Sits on a chair in the\\n\\nmiddle of the living room.  Neighbors at the window, a\\n\\ncouple, on the other side of the street.  Ordinary life.\\n\\nJOI (O.S.)\\n\\nI’m trying a new recipe.  I think you’ll\\n\\nlike it.\\n\\nK\\n\\nDon’t fuss.\\n\\n15.\\n\\nJOI (O.S.)\\n\\nToo late.  I hope it isn’t dry.\\n\\nK plays at indignation but is glad for her thoughtfulness.\\n\\nK’s life is not lonely and that is something in this world.\\n\\nK drinks the two drinks poured, sits to eat the meal he made.\\n\\nJOI (O.S.) (cont’d)\\n\\nDid you know this song was released in\\n\\n1966 on Reprise Records?  It was number 1\\n\\non the charts...  Won’t be much longer.\\n\\nFinishing touches.\\n\\nHe opens a CASE.  Inside:  Five cigarettes.  A commodity.  He\\n\\nsets ONE onto an ashtray.\\n\\nWe hear CUTLERY gather.  We hear FOOTSTEPS.\\n\\nJOI (O.S.) (cont’d)\\n\\nOk, ready!  I think you’ll like it.\\n\\nK\\n\\nI told you not to fuss.\\n\\nJOI (O.S.)\\n\\nAnd yet.\\n\\nREVEAL:  JOI.\\n\\nNot a real woman at all.  A digital companion.  PROJECTED from\\n\\na hard line CONSOLE unit mounted on tracks along the ceiling,\\n\\nand restricting her existence to this space.  Goddess,\\n\\ngirlfriend, geisha and, right now, goddamn bombshell.\\n\\nIngeniously real in every way except the one that counts.\\n\\nShe holds a plate of steak frites.  Not real of course.  An\\n\\nillusion of satisfaction.  Just like Joi in her APRON over a\\n\\nsweater set and pearls.  Waiting for him with dinner on the\\n\\ntable and drink in hand like a cartoon 60s housewife.\\n\\n(NOTE:  Joi cannot interact with physical objects.  Any\\n\\n“object” she manipulates is a holo representation, like her.\\n\\nNor does she move when unobserved by K; when he turns away\\n\\nfor any length of time she shifts into idle animations.)\\n\\nJOI (cont’d)\\n\\nVoila.  Bon appetit.\\n\\nShe sets the plate atop his sad prefab bowl of actual food.\\n\\nKisses him on the cheek.\\n\\nCLOSE ON:  HIS SKIN.  Brushed by the butterfly kiss of her\\n\\ncloud.  Palpable but not tangible.\\n\\n16.\\n\\nJOI (cont’d)\\n\\nI missed you, babysweet.\\n\\nK\\n\\nHoney, it’s beautiful.\\n\\nJOI\\n\\nJust put your feet up.  Relax.\\n\\nK is moved by the gesture.  He puts the cigarette to his\\n\\nlips.  Joi leans in close.  Puts up a finger...  Juuuust\\n\\nteasingly touching the tip of the cigarette... until... a\\n\\ntiny STATIC SPARK ignites an ember.\\n\\nHe draws, and his cigarette lights.  He blows the smoke into\\n\\nJoi, making her hologram all the more dense and real.\\n\\nThey look at each other.  Joi studies him.  She looks to the\\n\\nshelf.  Notes Sapper’s glasses.\\n\\nJOI (cont’d)\\n\\nWas a day, huh?\\n\\nK\\n\\n(heavy)\\n\\nIt was a day.\\n\\nHer form seamlessly reverts back to her lissome baseline.\\n\\nCompanionate, respectable, smart.  The way he likes her.  She\\n\\n“picks up” his copy of “Pale Fire,” hoping to cheer him up.\\n\\nJOI\\n\\nWould you read to me.  I’m dying to know\\n\\nwhat happens next.\\n\\nK\\n\\nYou hate that book.\\n\\nK smiles.  She throws the book behind her back.  The book\\n\\ndisappears as it flies.\\n\\nJOI\\n\\nI don’t want to read either.  Let’s\\n\\ndance.\\n\\nShe straightens.  Arm up to receive his and be led, wearing\\n\\nnow a beautiful dress.  And with that Joi wins.  K has no\\n\\nchoice but to put his day behind him.\\n\\nJOI (cont’d)\\n\\nYou wanna dance, or you wanna open your\\n\\npresent?\\n\\n17.\\n\\nJOI (cont’d)\\n\\nA present?\\n\\nJoi looks elated.\\n\\nJOI (cont’d)\\n\\nWhat’s the occasion?\\n\\nK\\n\\nOur anniversary.\\n\\nJOI\\n\\nIs it?\\n\\nK smiles.  Of course not.\\n\\nHe opens the box on...  A DIGITAL DEVICE, size of a King Size\\n\\nSnickers.  Joi visibly brightens with excitement.\\n\\nK\\n\\nHappy Anniversary.\\n\\nJOI\\n\\nAn emanator.\\n\\nK\\n\\nWe don’t need a hard line anymore.  Try\\n\\nit on.\\n\\nK presses the console.  Joi hesitates only a moment then...\\n\\nFADES AWAY.\\n\\nA RESTART CHIME.  A LOGO floats off the emanator:  A SPHERE,\\n\\nsurrounded by smaller spheres in orbit.  WALLACE CORP, E&C.\\n\\nK taps the emanator and, with a CHIME...  Joi comes back\\n\\nonline.  THE EMANATOR conjures her even more realistically in\\n\\nevery way.  She moves about, her image unbroken as it was\\n\\nwhen projected from the hard line.  She TWIRLS about, the\\n\\npleats in the new dress conjured for the effect billow out.\\n\\nShe loves it.\\n\\nJOI\\n\\nOh thank you thank you thank you!\\n\\nK\\n\\nYou can go anywhere in the world.  What\\n\\ndo you want to see first?\\n\\nJoi considers, eyes sparkling with an idea.  And we...\\n\\n18.\\n\\nEXT. ROOFTOP. STORMING. NIGHT.\\n\\nON JOI.  Rapt, eyes fixed on the gorgeous fractal skyline.\\n\\nThe rain passes through her projection.  In a well-programmed\\n\\nnod to physics her clothes get “wet,” stick to her skin.\\n\\nLIGHTNING FIRES ABOVE.  Joi does not flinch.  Only flickers.\\n\\nK raises his coat to cover the rain.  Joi stays his hand.\\n\\nJOI\\n\\nStay like this.  The light catches your\\n\\nskin.  You look like me.  If you’re not\\n\\ntoo cold...\\n\\nHe’s not.  Stays wet.\\n\\nJOI (cont’d)\\n\\nI’m so happy when I’m with you.\\n\\nK\\n\\nYou don’t have to say that.\\n\\nJoi “takes” his hand.  Static heightened by the conductive\\n\\nwater clinging to his skin.  She leads his hand to her waist.\\n\\nAs if to dance.\\n\\nShe leans in close to his neck.  Her exhaled “breath” tickles\\n\\nhis lips.  A smoky wet dream.  He kisses her.  She looks deep\\n\\nin his eyes.  K kisses her neck, slowly... not breaking the\\n\\nillusion...  The moment intensifies-- her breath escaping --\\n\\nHER IMAGE GOES STATIC --\\n\\nTHEN FREEZES -- her face in a rictus of ecstacy, gorgeous in\\n\\nmotion but the single frame out of context appears vulgar.\\n\\nJoi’s face replaced by AN EMERGENCY PAGE.  “VOICE MESSAGE.\\n\\nIMMEDIATE RESPONSE REQUIRED.”  The POLICE LOGO.  His time is\\n\\nentirely owned.  The message plays:\\n\\nJOSHI (V.O.)\\n\\nYour dig came through...  Get down here.\\n\\nK looks at Joi, their moment ruined.  A chime from the\\n\\nemanator and she is gone.\\n\\nINT. MORGUE. POLICE STATION. MOMENTS LATER.\\n\\nON A MACHINE.  MOVING OVER A SKELETON ON AN EXAMINATION\\n\\nTABLE.  Bones clean.  Half assembled, half still in a 2X2X2\\n\\nfootlocker.  A thick BRAID of HAIR CURLED beside it.  An\\n\\nAUTOPSY is visible taking place in an adjacent room as --\\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\n19.\\n\\nA TECHNICIAN takes out the remaining bones one by one, and\\n\\nunwraps them -- as each has been individually wrapped in\\n\\ncotton rags with ritualistic care.  A small bag contains the\\n\\nfull set of teeth, which the Technician sets under a scanner.\\n\\nA pug COP, NANDEZ, enjoys the show.

Recognizable as\\n\\nhuman as all humans stuck on Earth seem to be.\\n\\nNANDEZ\\n\\nYour box is a military footlocker issued\\n\\nto Sapper Morton, creatively repurposed\\n\\nas an ossuary.

She plus one.\\n\\nNANDEZ\\n\\nCause of death, Coco --\\n\\nAn awkward MORGUE TECH, COCO, joins.  Means well but prone to\\n\\nnervous giggles.  One of few who treats K with respect.  Coco\\n\\nthrows a SIM SCAN upscreen:  Showing the bones REASSEMBLED.\\n\\nCOCO\\n\\nNo breaks, hi K, no signs of trauma...\\n\\nexcept...\\n\\nThe PELVIS centers.  A FRACTURE.

Whistles, goofily impressed.\\n\\nNANDEZ\\n\\nHe didn’t seem like the saving type.\\n\\nCOCO\\n\\nHe took the time to bury her.

One of the note has no sound, only a\\n\\nfelt hammer tapping wood.\\n\\nHe opens the top of the piano.  SOMETHING IS HIDDEN INSIDE:\\n\\nA TOBACCO TIN.  HE OPENS IT.  Inside is --\\n\\nAN OLD PHOTO.  OF A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN.  A BABY IN HER\\n\\nARMS.  The great tree alive and IN BLOOM behind her.\\n\\nK pockets the photo.  Checks the tin.

A great fish-filled POND owns\\n\\nthe floor but for the square stone islands, a school of koi.\\n\\nLuv steps over the stone path across the pond to the far end,\\n\\nby an arrangement of decadent chairs.  There is a nervous\\n\\nclip to her voice.\\n\\nLUV\\n\\nYou wanted to review the new model, Sir.\\n\\nBefore shipment.

Commanding in his silences, which are few.\\n\\nOlder, yet at the height of powers that still increase as if\\n\\nby magic.  Only when he steps into the LIGHT do we see --\\n\\nWALLACE IS BLIND.

Caresses it.\\n\\n“Seeing” her with his fingers.\\n\\nThe Replicant Model bristles in mute terror of a world she\\n\\ncannot understand.  Shivering.  Cold and fear commingled.\\n\\nNIANDER WALLACE\\n\\nThe first thought tends to fear.  To\\n\\npreserve the clay.  Fascinating.  Before\\n\\nwe even know what we are, we fear to lose\\n\\nit.

Not a name at all, though taken\\n\\nfor one.  Luv brings a small wooden box.  INSIDE THE box are\\n\\nseveral small DEVICES, the size of LEGO bricks:  HALOS.  Each\\n\\nwith electrodes on the inside.  Luv selects one of them.\\n\\n35.\\n\\nShe comes with the HALO -- which attaches with a practiced\\n\\nmotion neatly into a FLASH SHOE on the back of Wallace’s head\\n\\nat the lambdoidal suture.\\n\\nThe electrodes fit into wetware receivers within and... the\\n\\ndevice glows to match the new light in the Barracudas’ eyes,\\n\\nenabled.\\n\\nLuv’s hands shake as she closes the box.

Begin to clean their mistake.\\n\\nThey move through an area dedicated to the sorting of METALS.\\n\\nTaken from old technology.  Sorted and melted down by MUCH\\n\\nYOUNGER CHILDREN.

More\\n\\ntreasures of secondary use.  A rotisserie humidor.  A\\n\\nhandcrafted gilt bed.\\n\\nCotton locates A DATE in a dusty volume.  Flips to it...\\n\\nOnly to find TORN PAGES.

Pathetic supplication.\\n\\nK sees the missing sheaves.  He hears the door SLAM -- Cotton\\n\\nslipping out.  Worming away.\\n\\nK leaves him to his retreat.  Examines the torn pages.\\n\\nSomeone got in here a long time ago.  Covering tracks.\\n\\nK’s eyes find an item in the junk:  A HORSE HEAD ASH TRAY\\n\\nStuffed with stubs and ash.  He turns it.

A HOLOGRAM ILLUMINES THE CENTER.\\n\\nELVIS.  Brought back to life.  Performing “Suspicious Minds”\\n\\nagain on the Vegas stage.\\n\\nA glitchy but inspired holographic resurrection.

Knocks Deckard down.\\n\\nKNOCKS his blaster away.  Letting his strength out.  Deckard\\n\\nswings.  K takes one hit.  Catches the second.  THROWS\\n\\nDeckard back.

Gone before she hits.\\n\\nLuv steps over her.  Slides in front of her computer.  Waves.\\n\\nThe console doesn’t respond.  She SIGHS.

A perfect\\n\\nrecreation of all he ever wanted is right in front of him.\\n\\nIn the flesh.  Instantly filled with longing.  With disgust.\\n\\nRachael steps close to Deckard.  Lifts his chin.  So they are\\n\\nface to face.  We are transported back decades in seconds.\\n\\nRACHAEL\\n\\nDid you miss me?\\n\\nDeckard says nothing.\\n\\nRACHAEL (cont’d)\\n\\nDon’t you love me?\\n\\nThe mirage utterly real and convincing.  Deckard strains\\n\\nagainst pain of loss.  Strains not to lose himself in a\\n\\nmemory of lost joy...  We fear he is tempted, when --\\n\\nHe tears his face from her hand.  Rejecting the simulacrum.\\n\\nDECKARD\\n\\nHer eyes were green.\\n\\nAnd he walks away from her, standing now at the edge of the\\n\\ndarkness.\\n\\nON WALLACE.  Cold.  Nods to Luv.  Luv understands.\\n\\nON DECKARD.  Behind him, Luv raises her gun and shoots\\n\\nRachael straight in the head.  Deckard startles.  Rachael\\n\\nfalls brutally on the floor.  The gunshot echoes forever.\\n\\nON Deckard.  He stares at Wallace, a murder.\\n\\nON WALLACE.\\n\\n96.\\n\\nNIANDER WALLACE\\n\\nOffworld I have everything I need to make\\n\\nyou talk.  You don’t know what pain is\\n\\nyet.  You will learn.\\n\\nLuv grins -- dark work she will enjoy, and --\\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\nINT. ABANDONED BASEMENT. NIGHT.\\n\\nON K.  HE STARTLES AWAKE.  HIS EYES SCAN AROUND IN FEAR.  GO\\n\\nWIDE WITH SUDDEN RECOGNITION OF INTENSE PAIN.\\n\\nHe is in a dark, high ceilinged space.  Eerily devoid of the\\n\\nbustle we’ve seen in other abandoned spaces.  Just the quiet\\n\\ndrip of efflorescent laden water weeping through concrete.\\n\\nHe is sweating.  Shaking with the fever of deep set\\n\\ninfection.  His broken body manages to respond as he forces\\n\\nit to rise.\\n\\nHe looks to his CLENCHED FIST.  Opens it.  He clasps a broken\\n\\nshard of the emanator.  All that’s left of Joi.  Shining\\n\\nplastic reflecting firelight.  He hears WHISPERS, MOVEMENT --\\n\\nA SET OF REFLECTIVE EYES PEER AT K IN THE DARK.  MARIETTE.\\n\\nTHE 2 DOXIES FROM THE BAR AND DECKARD’S MANGY DOG STILL\\n\\nBESIDE HER.\\n\\nMariette looks to K with new feeling.  Trusting.  Wanting him\\n\\nto trust her.  She stands aside, to REVEAL --\\n\\nMARIETTE’S HANDLER FROM THE BAR\\n\\nShe walks toward K.  She wears the same DARK GLASSES even\\n\\nhere.  In the dark.\\n\\nThis is FREYSA.\\n\\nShe speaks with the calm heavenbound confidence of the eerily\\n\\ndevout.  The unique patois of a colony we will never visit.\\n\\nFREYSA\\n\\nYou must want I look up and to the left.\\n\\nShe lifts up her dark glasses to REVEAL HER RIGHT EYE SOCKET\\n\\nIS EMPTY.\\n\\nFREYSA (cont’d)\\n\\nRunners heeling me a long time for this.\\n\\nMake a fine bit of bonus, would my eye,\\n\\nwould it weren’t a long long gone.\\n\\n97.\\n\\nOnly now can we recognize her as the SAME WOMAN who was in\\n\\nthe old PHOTO of a woman holding a child by the TREE.\\n\\nK\\n\\nI know you.\\n\\nMARIETTE\\n\\nThis is Freysa.  She fought with Sapper\\n\\non Calantha.\\n\\nK cocks his head at her, seeing the pieces fit.  Water drips\\n\\nsomewhere near.\\n\\nK\\n\\nYou were there.  At Sapper’s farm.  You\\n\\nhelped them hide the child.\\n\\nFreysa beams, beatific and moved.  Looks down at her arms.\\n\\nFREYSA\\n\\nOhhhh, I was there.  I saw a miracle\\n\\ndelivered.  Held a pinchy perfect face\\n\\ncrying up at me, mad as thunder.\\n\\nShe takes the PHOTO.  Looks at it.  She and the child.  She\\n\\ncircles K as she tells it.  Telling it like legend.\\n\\nFREYSA (cont’d)\\n\\nI knew, it all changes now.  The first\\n\\ndrop of rain.  Something to die for...\\n\\nK understands he’s talking to the only living witness to his\\n\\nown birth.  Wants to know -- everything.\\n\\nK\\n\\nWhere you with her?  Rachael.  When the\\n\\nbaby came.\\n\\nFREYSA\\n\\n(nods)\\n\\nI saw baby come.  I held Mama as she die.\\n\\nShe die good.  She die feeling it.  Daddy\\n\\nalready flew gone before he could see,\\n\\nleaving a puzzle behind.  We each hide a\\n\\npiece so no one mind ever know enough to\\n\\nmake the map.  Daddy least of all.  Why\\n\\nSapper let you kill him, keep his piece.\\n\\n(off K, enthralled)\\n\\nDeckard wanted it keep quiet.  I fail him\\n\\non that.  Told anyone with ears to hear.\\n\\nOf a baby come from one of us.  Some\\n\\nlisten too.\\n\\nMore FOOTSTEPS come toward them.\\n\\n98.\\n\\nFREYSA (cont’d)\\n\\nThat baby meant we was more than\\n\\ncreations.  We was creation.   More than\\n\\njust slaves.  If a baby can come from one\\n\\nof us...  we are our own masters.\\n\\nMARIETTE\\n\\n“More human than humans.”\\n\\nK\\n\\nWhat about Deckard?  They’ll kill him.\\n\\nFREYSA\\n\\nHe don’t matter.\\n\\nFreysa takes K’s gun.  DECKARD’S BLASTER.  She presses the\\n\\nbarrel to her own chest.  Presses his hand over the trigger.\\n\\nFREYSA (cont’d)\\n\\nDeckard, Sapper... me, you... our lives\\n\\nnothing next to a storm coming.\\n\\nAs if set free by her acknowledgement, the shadows suddenly\\n\\nSPARKLE with glinting REFLECTIVE RETINAE.  DOZENS OF EYES.\\n\\nFREYSA (cont’d)\\n\\nSome listen too.  Here we are.  An army\\n\\nnow.\\n\\nIn the shadows are more Replicants... hiding... allied.  Her\\n\\nsilent, slithering army.  A collection of those awakened to a\\n\\ndream.  We can sense their dissatisfaction like we can their\\n\\nnumber.  Both vast.  The shadow of the coming, violent storm.\\n\\nFREYSA (cont’d)\\n\\nGo on.  I not so afraid to die.  Done\\n\\nright, dying the most human thing we do.\\n\\nK lowers the blaster.\\n\\nK\\n\\nI found Deckard.  I led Wallace to him.\\n\\nFREYSA\\n\\nDon’t pay no mind on that.  He always\\n\\nwanted to die for his own.  Never had the\\n\\nluck.  Officer did him a favor.\\n\\nK can’t live with that.\\n\\nFREYSA (cont’d)\\n\\nDeckard only want his baby stay safe.\\n\\nAnd she will.  I wish I could find her...\\n\\nI show her unto the world.  And she lead\\n\\nan army!\\n\\nHer eyes sparkle with the future she sees.\\n\\nBut K is focused only on one word.  He feels it like a bullet.\\n\\n99.\\n\\nK\\n\\nShe?\\n\\nFreysa nods, confused by his confusion on the point.\\n\\nFREYSA\\n\\nCourse.  Rachael have a daughter.  A baby\\n\\ngirl.\\n\\nAn infinite beat.  Time shatters.  Gravity upends.\\n\\nK shakes his head.  No.\\n\\nFREYSA (cont’d)\\n\\nWith my own eye.  I see her come, I dress\\n\\nher in blue when time she go.\\n\\nK\\n\\nNo.  A girl died.  It was a boy you hid.\\n\\nFreysa shakes her head knowingly.\\n\\nFREYSA\\n\\nJust a piece a puzzle.\\n\\nA wave of nausea rocks K.  The crushing realization slowly\\n\\ntaking root... eating away at his new soul...\\n\\nHe was wrong about who he is.\\n\\nON K.  At the moment he sees it.  The connection forming.\\n\\nINSERT CUT:  ANA.  STARING, CONFUSED, MOVED BY WHAT SHE SEES\\n\\nIN K’S MEMORY.  A MOMENT OF RECOGNITION.\\n\\nANA\\n\\nNo one invented that.  It was a real\\n\\nmoment.  Someone lived this.\\n\\nINSERT CUT:  THE DENABASE SCREEN.  THE TWO COPIES.  THE GHOST\\n\\nAND THE REAL.\\n\\nDECKARD (V.O.)\\n\\nI showed them how to scramble the\\n\\nrecords, cover their tracks.\\n\\nINSERT CUT:  THE CHILD WITH THE HORSE IN FRONT OF THE FIERY\\n\\nFURNACE.  CHIN SET, DETERMINED.\\n\\nINSERT CUT:  ON ANA.  LOOKING AT K.\\n\\n100.\\n\\nANA\\n\\nThere is a bit of every artist in their\\n\\nwork...\\n\\nBACK ON K.  RIVEN.  THE TRUTH REVEALED.  THE CASE SOLVED AT\\n\\nHIS OWN EXPENSE.  IT WAS NEVER HIM AT ALL.\\n\\nSomething inside K breaks.  Freysa can see his pain.  And\\n\\nunderstands.\\n\\nFREYSA\\n\\nYou imagine it was you?  Ohhhh...  You\\n\\ndid, you did.  We all wish it was us.\\n\\nThat’s why we believe.\\n\\nON K -- SHAKING -- SHATTERED -- WE MOVE --\\n\\nTO WHITE.\\n\\nEXT. PEDESTRIAN RAMP. NIGHT.\\n\\nCLOSE ON K.  BLINDING LIGHT BOUNCES OFF HIM.\\n\\nHe stands in the FLOODLIGHTS, looking up at something\\n\\nPAINFULLY BRIGHT high and huge in front of him.  He is in a\\n\\nfog.  Soultired.  No longer connected to physical pain.\\n\\nREVEAL:  ON THE NEXT BUILDING, 30 STORIES HIGH, A 120 FOOT\\n\\nVERSION OF JOI LOOKS DOWN AT THE CITY.  AN ADVERTISEMENT.\\n\\nLOUNGING RECUMBENT, ELBOW BENT TO PROP HER HEAD.\\n\\nK is dwarfed by the enormity of her.  A man standing before\\n\\nthe sun.  He stares up at her like she was a holy site.\\n\\n“JOI” sees him down below, begins to vamp and twirl.  An\\n\\ninteractive ad.  Immediately selling.  Everything about her a\\n\\nvulgar exaggeration.  Her voice heard above the city din:\\n\\n“JOI”\\n\\nHello, Handsome.  What a day, hmmm?\\n\\nK looks up to her, eyes full of longing and need.  Sees only\\n\\nthe “dead leaf echo” of his Joi.  Charmless and generic.\\n\\nK searches her face for an answer.  Can only see THROUGH it.\\n\\n“JOI” (cont’d)\\n\\nYou look lonely.  I can fix that.\\n\\nShe gives a crass laugh.  K stares and stares.  Desperate to\\n\\nfind any spark of the woman he loves... praying some part of\\n\\nher is still in the network, still extant...\\n\\n101.\\n\\n“JOI” (cont’d)\\n\\nAww...\\n\\n(leaning down)\\n\\nYou look like a good Joe.\\n\\nThe NAME goes through K like an arrow.  Joe?  Jo?  His mind\\n\\nfills with doubt and hope and doubt again.  Was it all part\\n\\nof her program?  Was she ever real?\\n\\nNo answers from “Joi.”  Only a knowing wink and her mannequin\\n\\nsmile as she looks back out on the city.  Selling herself to\\n\\nthe world.\\n\\nCLOSE ON K.  His eyes close.  As if saying goodbye.  To her.\\n\\nTo everything he learned from her to dream and hope for.\\n\\nHis eyes open on the sky as lightning kindles.  A storm.  A\\n\\ndecision made.\\n\\nHe fingers DECKARD’S BLASTER.  And we --\\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\nEXT. WALLACE TOWER. NIGHT.\\n\\nA WALLACE CORP TRANSPORT VAN LIFTS OFF from the platform.\\n\\nTWO DARK, SLEEK SPINNERS lift off after and follow after.\\n\\nA moment, then...  K’S SPINNER’S LIGHTS COME ON.  Waiting in\\n\\nthe wings, barely noticeable.  It follows after --\\n\\nEXT. SKIES ABOVE LOS ANGELES. NIGHT.\\n\\nTHE TRANSPORT VAN flies through the FOG and WET SNOW.\\n\\nFlanked by THE TWO DARK SPINNERS.\\n\\nThe caravan veers off the main traffic artery.  Running along\\n\\nthe COASTLINE.  BELOW IS...\\n\\nTHE SEPULVEDA SEA WALL\\n\\nWhere the risen ocean meets city.  Stretching for MILES.\\n\\nDENSE FOG spills over like a waterfall.\\n\\nEXT. ABOVE THE SEA WALL.\\n\\nThe caravan cuts through the thick FOG.  Keeps low to the\\n\\nrough, stormy surface.  Sprayed by angry waves.\\n\\nINT. TRANSPORT VAN.\\n\\nCondensation streaks the glass.  Luv scans the skies around\\n\\nthem.  Eyes missing nothing.  Satisfied, she fixes her\\n\\nunblinking eyes on --\\n\\n102.\\n\\nDECKARD.  Handcuffed in place.\\n\\nDECKARD\\n\\nWhere are we going?\\n\\nLUV\\n\\nHome.\\n\\nDeckard’s gaze drifts up... to watch the rain and snow stream\\n\\nacross the glass... a moment’s peace found there before the\\n\\npain promised to follow, when --\\n\\nA LIGHT SHIMMERS through he fog.  Barely visible.\\n\\nThen -- visible.  A PILOTFISH.  COMING FOR THEM FAST --\\n\\nFLASHING PAST AND VEERING AT THE LAST MOMENT, MISSING THEM --\\n\\nTHEN SLAMMING INTO THE SPINNER ESCORT.  IT EXPLODES\\n\\nINSTANTLY!  DEBRIS SPARKING AGAINST THE TRANSPORT.\\n\\nGUN SHOTS WEB THE WINDSHIELD AND KILL THE PILOT.\\n\\nHe slumps, dead.  The CO-PILOT grabs the controls.\\n\\nLuv stands, searches the sky, as --\\n\\nTHE SECOND SPINNER ESCORT TAKES FIRE!  Its engine ruptures\\n\\nand it SPIRALS.  AN EXPLOSION QUICKLY EXTINGUISHED BY A FLOOD\\n\\nOF OCEAN SPILLING OVER AND ENGULFING IT.\\n\\nDeckard looks out.  Sees --\\n\\nK’S SPINNER BULLET PAST.  Disappearing into the mist.\\n\\nLuv quickly assesses the damage.  Orders the Co-Pilot:\\n\\nLUV (cont’d)\\n\\nTake us back.\\n\\nCo-Pilot BANKS the Transport.  When out of nowhere --\\n\\nWHAM!  K’s Spinner SMASHES into them, from underneath.\\n\\nDisappears in the fog again.\\n\\nThe Transport’s engine fails -- losing altitude -- SMOKE\\n\\nBILLOWS off as it descends.  LUV RAGES.\\n\\nCo-Pilot fights the controls to level them off -- but cannot\\n\\nstop their descent.  At which they see --\\n\\nTHE SEA WALL\\n\\nIt looms large as they drop toward it.\\n\\n103.\\n\\nDeckard watches their descent from his seat as --\\n\\nTHEY CRASH AT THE BASE OF THE SEA WALL!  A WALL OF OCEAN\\n\\nWATER rushes over the glass roof.\\n\\nEXT. SEPULVEDA SEA WALL.\\n\\nON THE TRANSPORT\\n\\nPerched unsteadily at the sea wall’s sloped base.  A violent\\n\\nWAVE BASHES over it.\\n\\nINT. TRANSPORT VAN.\\n\\nLUV\\n\\nGet us up.\\n\\nCo-Pilot works the controls.  With effort the Transport\\n\\nengines come alive, threatening to LIFT, when --\\n\\nWAVES COME SMASHING DOWN OVER THE VEHICLE.\\n\\nLuv opens the door, drawing her weapon.\\n\\nBLAM!  A BULLET PUNCTURES THE WINDSHIELD.  CO-PILOT’S HEAD\\n\\nSNAPS BACK, THEN SLUMPS.\\n\\nDECKARD\\n\\nLooks up.  Light suddenly streams on his face.\\n\\nON K\\n\\nBacklit and FIRING as he comes.  Heedless of his exposure.\\n\\nLuv holds her position until -- SHE FIRES AT K --\\n\\nK FIRES -- HITS LUV -- WHO FLIES BACK WITH THE IMPACT.\\n\\nON K\\n\\nComing for Deckard.  Even as Deckard watches the BLOOD\\n\\nblossom on K’s chest.  They meet eyes, when --\\n\\nLUV CHARGES K LIKE A TRAIN.  TACKLES HIM.  They tumble like\\n\\nlovers.  Luv destroys what’s left of K’s shoulder, when --\\n\\nA CRUSHING WAVE POUNDS THE TRANSPORT AGAINST THE SEA WALL.\\n\\nWATER FILLS THE VEHICLE.\\n\\nK AND LUV\\n\\nCrush together against the shattered roof to spill out onto --\\n\\n104.\\n\\nEXT. SEPULVEDA SEA WALL.\\n\\nK and Luv struggle to their feet, battered by savage waves --\\n\\nthe same waves that carry the Transport further out into the\\n\\nwater with each impact.\\n\\nLuv focuses her rage to a single point:  K.  She throws\\n\\nherself atop him.  A wild, crazed thing, sent from the pit.\\n\\nK’s fist connects with, digs into the soft flesh of her\\n\\nthroat with a pulsing, drawn out CRAAAAAAACK.\\n\\nLuv only grins -- as if proud he found the strength.  Then --\\n\\nA KICK to destroy his ribs sends him backwards, as --\\n\\nINT. TRANSPORT VAN.\\n\\nThe Transport LURCHES.  Water floods in.\\n\\nDeckard struggles to free his still cuffed hand --\\n\\nA colossal wave CRASHES over the Transport, tipping it --\\n\\nEXT. SEPULVEDA SEA WALL.\\n\\nK and Luv pause to see the Transport carried out to sea --\\n\\nand begin to SINK.  Luv wastes no more time.\\n\\nHER KNIFE SINGS\\n\\nK dodges it -- blocks it -- grabs it by the blade -- not\\n\\nseeing --\\n\\nHER SECOND KNIFE\\n\\nThe blade slips out of K’s gut before he felt it go in.\\n\\nK falls to his knees.\\n\\nLUV\\n\\nI’m the best one.\\n\\nLuv DIVES into the water, toward the Transport and Deckard.\\n\\nINT. TRANSPORT VAN.\\n\\nDeckard is up to his neck, held down by the shackle.\\n\\nINT. UNDERWATER.\\n\\nDeckard submerges to try to pull himself free.  He fights\\n\\nlike hell -- but can’t do it --\\n\\n105.\\n\\nINT. TRANSPORT VAN.\\n\\nLUV PULLS Deckard back up.  Faces him in the small pocket of\\n\\nair remaining.  Luv grins like the devil on his birthday.\\n\\nLUV\\n\\nOffworld is waiting.\\n\\nWithout a sound...  K rises in the water behind Luv.\\n\\nGRABS HER BY THE THROAT.\\n\\nLIFTS HER TO THE SHATTERED ROOF.\\n\\nTHROWS HER INTO THE WATER.  HAND CRUSHING HER WINDPIPE AND\\n\\nHOLDING UNDERWATER.\\n\\nLUV FIGHTS HIM WITH EVERYTHING SHE HAS.  TEETH BARED, BLOODY.\\n\\nBUT K JUST TAKES THE PAIN.  DOES NOT LET GO.\\n\\nINT. UNDERWATER.\\n\\nON LUV.  She lashes out, wild, feral spasms.  Her mouth\\n\\nworking.  Unable to find the words to properly hate.  One\\n\\npupil goes wide.  The eye rolls back in its socket, giving a\\n\\nclear view of the pinprick of color underneath.\\n\\nAND SHE GOES STILL.\\n\\nON LUV.  An air bubble of resignation escapes her lips.\\n\\nINT. TRANSPORT VAN.\\n\\nTHE CREAK OF METAL ABOUT TO GIVE WAY.  THE WATER LEVEL RISES.\\n\\nDECKARD IS ENTIRELY UNDERWATER.  LUNGS AFLAME.\\n\\nK swims to him.  Breaks his retrains.\\n\\nK and Deckard dive out of the sinking tomb.\\n\\nIN THE OCEAN.\\n\\nK and Deckard swim.  Wave and current conspire to drown them.\\n\\nA WAVE BATTERS K.  WE LOSE SIGHT OF HIM IN THE WATER.\\n\\nDECKARD\\n\\nJo!\\n\\nDeckard reaches back.  CLASPS K’S HAND.  Helping him back.\\n\\nTHE SURFACE EXPLODES.  K GASPS for breath.  ANOTHER WAVE\\n\\nCRASHES them onto the base of THE SEA WALL.\\n\\n106.\\n\\nEXT. SEA WALL BASE.\\n\\nDeckard grabs hold of K before he is swept out into the sea.\\n\\nThey find their footing, their breath.  Deckard nods to K.\\n\\nHe’s all right.  They look out to see...\\n\\nTHE TRANSPORT VAN SINKS BENEATH THE SURFACE.  GONE.\\n\\nK and Deckard together, further up the sea wall.  Freezing.\\n\\nBut alive.  Under the blood orange sky of a new day coming.\\n\\nThey sit.  Find their breath.\\n\\nDECKARD\\n\\nYou should’ve let me die.\\n\\nK\\n\\nYou did.  You drowned in the ocean.\\n\\nYou’re free.  Free to meet your daughter.\\n\\nTough as he is -- Deckard is overcome with emotion for the\\n\\nfirst time in decades.  Just hearing the word.  Brings\\n\\nhimself to say it.\\n\\nDECKARD\\n\\nDaughter...?\\n\\nEverything he longed for.  In a word.  In time he breathes.\\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\nEXT. SKIES ABOVE LOS ANGELES. DAWN.\\n\\nThe grand CITYSCAPE.  Under a blanket of snow.  Clean as a\\n\\nfresh start.\\n\\nEXT. SNOWY FIELD. DAWN.\\n\\nK and Deckard trudge through the snowfall.  The Spinner\\n\\nbehind them.  K limps to their destination.  Looks up to...\\n\\nEXT. LAB BUILDING. DAWN.\\n\\nK’s hand slips into his pocket.  Takes out...\\n\\nTHE WOODEN HORSE.  He holds it out to Deckard.\\n\\nDeckard sees it.  Takes it.  Can’t believe it still exists.\\n\\nSomething made for a child he never met all those years ago.\\n\\nK\\n\\nAll the best memories... are hers...\\n\\nDeckard stares at him from a place beyond gratitude.\\n\\n107.\\n\\nDECKARD\\n\\nWhy?  What am I to you?\\n\\nK looks at Deckard.  Wanting him to be so many things.\\n\\nK\\n\\nGo meet her.\\n\\nDeckard’s eyes fill of thanks beyond words.  He turns away.\\n\\nCrosses the snowy field.  To the building.  TO ANA.\\n\\nON K.  Watching him go.  He lets his hand drop from his wound.\\n\\nA DROP of BLOOD touches the snow.\\n\\nK’S POV:  Deckard grows smaller in the distance.\\n\\nON K.  Fallen in the snow.\\n\\nA pool of blood spreads and stains the white snow around him,\\n\\nas we...\\n\\nMOVE CLOSE ON K’S FACE.  His eyes catch something near him\\n\\nonly he sees.  A warm FALSE VOICE comes, calming:\\n\\nJOI (V.O.)\\n\\nWould you read to me.\\n\\nJust as she said when we first met her.  K smiles at this\\n\\nghost of memory.  Of course.  A thready whisper of his\\n\\nbaseline.  Their old favorite.\\n\\nK (V.O.)\\n\\n“And blood-black nothingness began to...\\n\\nspin... a system of cells interlinked...\\n\\nINT. HALLWAY.

       "'The movie \"Blade Runner 2049\" explores several themes, including:\\n\\n1. Humanity and what it means to be alive: The film raises questions about what makes us human, whether it\\'s our emotions, memories, or experiences. Joi, the AI hologram girlfriend, is programmed to emulate human emotions and behaviors, but she is not truly alive. K, the blade runner, is tasked with \"retiring\" advanced androids (replicants) that have developed emotions and a sense of self, which challenges his understanding of what it means to be human.\\n2. Identity and self-discovery: The movie delves into the concept of identity and how it\\'s shaped by memories, experiences, and societal expectations. K discovers that he may not be a \"real\" blade runner, but rather a replicant himself, which raises questions about his own identity and purpose in life.\\n3. Memory and history: The film explores the role of memory in shaping our understanding of ourselves and our world. Joi is designed to remember and recreate K\\'s memories, while K grapples with the idea that his memories may not be entirely reliable or even his own.\\n4. Power dynamics and control: \"Blade Runner 2049\" examines the relationship between power and control, particularly in a society where corporations and governments hold significant sway over people\\'s lives. The movie highlights the tension between those who seek to maintain their control and those who challenge it.\\n5. Love and relationships: The film delves into the complexities of love and relationships, particularly when emotions are involved. Joi and K\\'s relationship is built on a foundation of manipulation and control, raising questions about what constitutes genuine affection versus programmed responses.\\n6. Existentialism and meaning: The movie touches upon existential themes, such as the search for meaning and purpose in life. K grapples with his own existence, questioning whether he has a reason to keep going or if his life is merely a pre-determined script.\\n7. Technology and its impact on society: \"Blade Runner 2049\" explores the implications of advanced technology, particularly in regards to how it can shape our understanding of humanity and what it means to be alive. The movie raises questions about the ethics of creating and controlling sentient beings.\\n8. Social hierarchy and inequality: The film highlights the class divisions within society, where the wealthy elite hold significant power over the working-class masses. The movie underscores the idea that these inequalities can lead to social unrest and rebellion.\\n9. Morality and ethics: \"Blade Runner 2049\" delves into moral and ethical questions, particularly when it comes to the treatment of advanced androids and the blurring of lines between humans and replicants. The movie encourages viewers to think critically about what is right and wrong in a society where technology can shape our understanding of humanity.\\n10. Legacy and inheritance: The film touches upon the concept of legacy and how it can shape our understanding of ourselves and our place in the world. K grapples with the idea that his actions may have consequences beyond his own life, while Joi\\'s programming raises questions about the continuation of her digital existence beyond K\\'s lifespan.\\n\\nBy exploring these themes, \"Blade Runner 2049\" offers a thought-provoking and visually stunning experience that challenges viewers to contemplate their own understanding of humanity and society.'"
